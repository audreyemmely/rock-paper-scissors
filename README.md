# How to play?
First of all, you will need to install the ```pygame``` library (if you don't already have it on your system). You can do the installation using the ```pip``` installer package, which is already built into python 3. 

Open your terminal and type ```pip install pygame```. (in some cases you need to use the command ```pip3 install pygame```)

If all goes well, you will receive a message of successful installation, in the terminal.

With the library installed, you will now clone this repository on your local machine, using the following command through the terminal: 
```
git clone https://github.com/audreyemmely/rock-paper-scissors.git
```
If you do not have GIT installed on your machine, you can download the repository in "zip" format, just click on the green button named "Code" (top right) and choose the option "Download ZIP". After that, unzip the file and follow the next instructions.
